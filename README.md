# Digit_Recognition_MNIST (Pygame Interface)

## Using the MNIST Dataset, a rudimentary neural network consisting of 4 layers (including the input and output layer) was trained to recognize handwritten digits. A Pygame interface was built to let the user draw a digit and the network displays its best guess.
